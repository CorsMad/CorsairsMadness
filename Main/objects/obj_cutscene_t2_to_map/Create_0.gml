page1 = @"Surely you have a lot of questions.
But not all at once, Captain. 
The hen takes it one day at a time. 
First, I'll tell you what to do next.
";

page3 =  @"Maybe you can still find your team.
I don't know exactly what happened to them, 
but that's a challenge for you, right?";

page4 = @"My friend, captain, 
in order to continue your search, 
you must get to a neighboring island. 
I do not recommend you to cross the sea
by swimming, it might be unwise.
";

page5 = @"I can help you with that, captain.
We're friends now, aren't we? 
I'm giving you this boat, so you can get 
to the next island without too much trouble.";

page6 = @"Good luck on your journey! 
We'll definitely meet again, and don't forget 
to stop by my shop.";
